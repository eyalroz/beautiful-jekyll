As a Ph.D. candidate, I served as a teaching assistant in the following courses (sorted by course level):

* Introduction to Computer Science (with C programming)
* Formal Logic and Set Theory
* Univariate Infinitesimal Calculus
* Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics
* Communication Complexity

at the Technion IIT's faculty of Computer Science. My current research institute, CWI, is not a university --- so, alas, there are no courses for me to teach. I have, however, given several workshop-style sessions:

* Introduction to GPU programming (in CUDA)
* Performance estimation and optimization of GPU kernels
* Improving host-side GPU-related code using modern C++ and the [cuda-api-wrappers](https://github.com/eyalroz/cuda-api-wrappers/) library (at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/))

My teaching dream: To get a batch of first-year undergraduate students and teach them a combined Math + Combinatorics introductory course using Knuth-Graham-Patashnik's amazing [Concrete Mathematics](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/gkp.html).

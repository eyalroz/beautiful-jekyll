I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/database-architectures/database-architectures">Database Architectures group</a> of <a href="https://www.cwi.nl">CWI</a>, Amsterdam, where I am hosted by <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/">Prof. Peter Boncz</a>. My research is currently focused on:

* Large-scale data processing using GPUs
* DBMS architecture in the presence of heterogeneous processing units
* (planned) Graph-grammatical query plan optimization

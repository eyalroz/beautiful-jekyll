I'm an independent researcher and a software consultant/contractor, with significant experience both in Academia and Industry. My research is currently focused on:

* Analytic column store (DBMS) architecture 
* GPU use in analytic query processing work
* Use of composable lightweight compression schemes in data-analytical work
* (planned) Graph-grammatical columnar query plan optimization

and my efforts in software are currently focused on:

* Contributions to [`cuDF` library][2], part of the [rapids.AI][1] project for enabling Machine Learning pipelines on single- and multi-GPUs.
* A CUDA kernel author toolkit's (in early stages)
* My [CUDA Modern-C++ API wrappers][3] library

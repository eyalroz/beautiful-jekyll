[comment]: <> (#subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me)

I hail from the beautiful city of [Haifa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-3dvpBqnCE), in Palestine/Israel --- where my heart remains even as my professional work takes me across the seas. My family (also involved in software and engineering) live there still.

It is also where my Alma Mater, the [Technion IIT](http://www.technion.ac.il/) is located. I completed my first course in Academia - Bachelor's studies, followed Graduate studies and research work on [Combinatorial Property testing](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/test.html), advised by [Prof. Eldar Fischer](http://eldar.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/) (making me an academic [grandson](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=58918) of the esteemed Noga Alon - which might help you place my academic origins within the world of Mathematics and Computer Science). I was also active in junior academic staff collective affairs, in different capacities; between 2009 and 2011 I served as the vice-chairperson of the Technion Graduate Student Organization.

After completing my Ph.D. work I veered off the course of Computer Science theory, looking for a different path (within and without of Computer Science). About two years later I joined Huawei Research Israel (a.k.a. Toga Networks), where a new Heterogenenous Computing group was forming as part of  [Huawei Research's Shannon Lab](http://www.vvcat.com/view/179208.html). My two years in the group brought me down from the 'Olympus' of abstract theory to the 'pits' of close-to-the-metal software work, counting clock cycles, measuring bandwidths and performing other dark arts in the pursuit of maximum performance. My time there is what got me hooked on GPUs, and other exotic computational devices in general, and picqued my interest in DBMSes.

Outside of my professional work, I follow world politics, and try to keep up-to-date with the innumerable social struggles going on back home in Israel/Palestine; if I can't participate myself, then at least vicariously. I'm also into cinema, and in the spare time I never have I sneak in some reading (mostly Science Fiction, social history, political-economic thought) and Ashtanga Yoga. Living in Amsterdam, I count my daily [bike rides](http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/plan-your-trip/getting-around/cycling) as a fun pastime as well.

Back in Haifa I also headed a tenant's committee in the condominium where I stayed, which was all rented out to working-class small families and students. That's where I developed my hobby for fixing things up --- as the landlords rarely paid what was necessary for even the most fundamental maintenance. So with my tools, my ladder and occasional help from my neighbors (a painter-and-lifeguard, a IT technician, a single-mother French teacher, and a friendly eccentric whose occupation I never quite figured out) we patched up walls and painted them, added railings and more lighting, got rid of tree branches growing into our windows and so on. I suppose all of that also inspires my tendency to tinker with computing hardware as well.
